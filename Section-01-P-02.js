//* Introduction to React

//? What is React?
//* According to React website, React is "The library for web and native Interfaces".

//* A JavaScript Library is a collection of pre-written code that's desinged to make development easier. This code can be reused/reimplemented in our own codebases to achieve more complex tasks.

//* React provides powerful primitives(built-in functions/modules) that allow us to build user interfaces of varying/different complexities.

//* React is the most powerful, widely used JavaScript library.

//* Frameworks make our code easily scalable, more readable, and possibly a thousand times more efficient.

//? Few reasons to learn React
//* -> Components are reusable
//* -> It's well-supported due to its popularity and large community.
//* -> It's opinionated, which means it won't force to follow any specific design patterns, project organizational structure, or logic.
//* -> There is a samller learning curve, especially if already have a good grasp of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from our previous lessons.

//? Major Frameworks -- Background and Life Cycle Trends
//* The LifeCycle duration and journey of a framework depend on how popular or widely used the framework is.

//* There are some Major Frameworks, that were very popular in thier time.
//* jQuery, AngularJS, VueJS and ReactJS have remained prominent names when it comes to top frontend frameworks for almost a decade now.

//! jQuery (JavaScript Library):
/*
 * jQuery was invented by Jhon Resig and was launched in 2006.
 * It was one of the earliest niche.
 * It is used for designing the web applications.
 * According to Stack Overflow surveys, the number of questions was high as 8% at a point of time. But it gradually fell to 2% during 2020.
 */

//! AngularJS
/*
 * Launched in 2010 by //! Google.
 * AngularJS supported the ability to generate reusable components.
 * In 2016, Google launched a TypeScript based open-source web application framework named Angular(Angular 2+).
 * Angular was an update to the previously introduced Angular JS with better features and compatibility.
 */

//! ReactJS
/*
 * React is Frontend library that was invented by Jordan Walke of Facebook.
 * It is owned and maintained by Facebook.
 * Launched in 2013.
 * The Reason of React was for the need of better code to manage Facebook Ads more Effectively.
 * The Framework is relevant today as it was back in 2013 and is only growing by the day.
 */

//! The difference between Library and Framework
//* Frameworks and Libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you to perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
//* A Framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A Library doesn't . The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
//* The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how "opinionated" it is.

//! The advantages of React JS are :
//* It is composable.
//* It is declarative. (DOM)
//* Write once, and learn anywhere.
//* It is simple.
//* SEO friendly. (Single Page)
//* Fast, efficient, and easy to learn.
//* It guarantees stable code.
//* It is backed by a strong community.
