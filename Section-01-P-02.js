//* Introduction to React

//? What is React?
//* According to React website, React is "The library for web and native Interfaces".

//* A JavaScript Library is a collection of pre-written code that's desinged to make development easier. This code can be reused/reimplemented in our own codebases to achieve more complex tasks.

//* React provides powerful primitives(built-in functions/modules) that allow us to build user interfaces of varying/different complexities.

//* React is the most powerful, widely used JavaScript libraries.

//* Frameworks make our code easily scalable, more readable, and possibly a thousand times more efficient.

//? Few reasons to learn React
//* -> Components are reusable
//* -> It's well-supported due to its popularity and large community.
//* -> It's opinionated, which means it won't force to follow any specific design patterns, project organizational structure, or logic.
//* -> There is a samller learning curve, especially if already have a good grasp of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from our previous lessons.
