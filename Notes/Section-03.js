//* States And Effects

/* 
? What is "State" in Programming?
* -  State is just the current snapshot of your program or of a part of it.
* - It's the combination all those individual states (like "modal is open" and "user is not authenticated") that makes up the overall program state.
* - We can also translate "State" with "Data", "Data that controls what the program is doing".

* - "State" is just "Data" - "Data which controls how the program is behaving" or "Data which has an effect on the result and output of a program".

//! Introduction
/*
 * React Provides primitives to manipulate the state of our components, to make them dynamic.
 * Any application we build is likely to change over the time the user is exploring it.
 * The changes could be as basic as togglong a dropdown menu or as compkec as fetching an API.
