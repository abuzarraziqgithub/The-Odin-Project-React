? What are Components?
* The beauty of React is it allows you to break the UI down into independent reusable chunks, which will refer to as components.
* Think of these reusable chunks as JavaScript functions which can take some kind of input and return a React Element.

? How to create Components?
* We created a functional Greeting Component in Components Folder inside the Project.
* The React components must be capitalized or they will not function as expected. which is why we capitalized Greeting().
? Why we should capitalized our React component?
* When the JSX is parsed, React uses the capitalization to tell the difference between an HTML tag and instance of a React component.
* <greeting /> would be interpreted as a normal HTML element with no special meaning, instead of your shiny new React component.
